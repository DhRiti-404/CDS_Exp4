# Operations with Operators (Bitwise) Programs in C++

## Tools Used
- **Language:** C++
- **Compiler:** g++ (GNU Compiler Collection)
- **IDE:** VS Code

## Theory

### Topic Overview
This experiment focuses on the usage of **bitwise operators** in C++. Bitwise operators operate directly on the binary representations of integers. They are commonly used in low-level programming, embedded systems, and situations where performance and memory efficiency are critical.

In this program, students will learn to apply the following bitwise operators:
- `&` (AND)
- `|` (OR)
- `^` (XOR)
- `~` (NOT)
- `<<` (Left Shift)
- `>>` (Right Shift)

### Program: `exp4.cpp` â€“ Bitwise Operations Demonstration
This program:
- Takes two integers as input from the user
- Performs and displays the result of various bitwise operations

#### Algorithm:
1. Input two integers `a` and `b` from the user
2. Perform the following bitwise operations:
   - `a & b`: Bitwise AND
   - `a | b`: Bitwise OR
   - `a ^ b`: Bitwise XOR
   - `~a`, `~b`: Bitwise NOT
   - `a << 1`: Left Shift `a` by 1 bit
   - `b >> 1`: Right Shift `b` by 1 bit
3. Display the results of all operations with appropriate labels

## Conclusion
This experiment helped me understand how bit-level manipulation works in C++. Bitwise operations are fundamental in scenarios like:
- Setting or clearing specific bits
- Creating efficient hardware drivers or memory access routines
- Implementing encryption algorithms and error detection techniques

Through this program, students gain practical insights into low-level binary operations and how they affect data in memory.
